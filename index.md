#### About Me
I am a researcher and engineer with broad interests. Most recently, I spent ~6 years at <a href="https://gencove.com/">Gencove</a>, an early-stage biotech startup bringing low-pass sequencing to industrial scale.
During my time there, I wore many hats.
Initially  hired as the first member of the research team, my job primarily entailed developing and "productionizing" statistical/ML and computational methodology around applications of low-pass whole genome sequencing.
Later, as the company grew, I led the effort in scaling up and spearheading the research team (formally as the director of data science, though this was a catch-all for research science, research engineering, etc.), and did a lot of work in developing and implementing novel methods in production pipelines that processed >1Pb of genomic data a year.

Before that, I worked at Genomic Prediction --- a genetics startup that develops pre-implantation genetic screening tests for complex (polygenic) traits --- as one of the first hires,  spearheaded development of the pilot screening product as well as the flagship polygenic disease risk screening product.

My academic background is in physics and applied math. 
Outside of work, I enjoy appreciating art; most notably, my favorite artists are Mark Rothko, Aphex Twin, and Hiroshi Sugimoto. 
I also enjoy outdoor activites such as mountaineering, rock climbing, and road biking. 

#### Background

I graduated in 2017 from the University of Washington, where I did my undergraduate studies in physics and chemistry as dual degrees.

At the same time, I was advised by <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/hqian/">Hong Qian</a> in the Department of Applied Mathematics with whom I worked on an interesting problem in the theory of non-autonomous nonlinear dynamical systems, which culminated in an interesting <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31700198/">paper</a> characterizing the dynamics of a non-autonomous version of the classical saddle-node bifurcation.

Prior to that, I did research with the <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/masiello/Masiello_Group_Website/Home.html">Masiello Group</a> in the Physics department, for which I earned the <a href="https://expd.uw.edu/mge/apply/research/">Mary Gates Research Scholarship</a>.

My interest in scientific research is long-standing and my earliest engagement with the discipline was working in the labs of <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/takato/">Takato Imaizumi</a> at UW and <a href="http://compbio.buffalo.edu/">Ram Samudrala</a> while in high school.
