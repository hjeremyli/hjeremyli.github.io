#### About Me
I am a scientist and researcher with broad interests. Most recently, I was the director of data science at <a href="https://gencove.com/">Gencove</a>, an early-stage biotech startup bringing low-pass sequencing to industrial scale. 
I hired, managed, and led a team of scientists working on problems in statistical and population genetics, and guided the research direction of the group.

Previously, as the first hire on the data science/research team in an IC role, my job primarily entailed developing and "productionizing" statistical and computational methodology around applications of low-pass whole genome sequencing.

Historically, my work has primarily been in human genomics but more recently has encompassed a wider variety of agricultural and model species. 

Previously, I worked at Genomic Prediction --- a genetics startup that develops pre-implantation genetic screening tests for complex (polygenic) traits --- as one of the first hires in the role of bioinformatics lead, and spearheaded the pilot screening product and was heavily involved in the development of the flagship polygenic disease risk screening product.

My academic background is in physics and applied math. 

Scientifically, I am interested in statistical and  population genetics, dynamical systems theory, and cliodynamics.
Aesthetically, I enjoy Mark Rothko, Aphex Twin, and Hiroshi Sugimoto. 
Recreationally, I enjoy mountaineering, rock climbing, and road biking. 

#### Background

I graduated in 2017 from the University of Washington, where I did my undergraduate studies in physics and chemistry as dual degrees.

At the same time, I was advised by <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/hqian/">Hong Qian</a> in the Department of Applied Mathematics with whom I worked on an interesting problem in the theory of non-autonomous nonlinear dynamical systems, which culminated in an interesting <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31700198/">paper</a> characterizing the dynamics of a non-autonomous version of the classical saddle-node bifurcation.

Prior to that, I did research with the <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/masiello/Masiello_Group_Website/Home.html">Masiello Group</a> in the Physics department, for which I earned the <a href="https://expd.uw.edu/mge/apply/research/">Mary Gates Research Scholarship</a>.

My interest in scientific research is long-standing and my earliest engagement with the discipline was working in the labs of <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/takato/">Takato Imaizumi</a> at UW and <a href="http://compbio.buffalo.edu/">Ram Samudrala</a> while in high school.
