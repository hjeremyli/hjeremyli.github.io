#### About me

I am a data scientist at <a href="https://gencove.com/">Gencove</a> working on problems in statistical genetics.

Previously, I worked at Genomic Prediction, a genetics startup that develops pre-implantation genetic screening tests for complex (polygenic) traits, as the bioinformatics lead, and spearheaded the pilot screening product and was heavily involved in the development of the flagship polygenic disease risk screening product.

#### Background

I graduated in 2017 from the University of Washington, where I did my undergraduate studies in physics and chemistry as dual degrees.
At the same time, I was advised by <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/hqian/">Hong Qian</a> in the Department of Applied Mathematics with whom I worked on an interesting problem in the theory of non-autonomous nonlinear dynamical systems, which culminated in a first-author publication.
Prior to that, I did research with the <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/masiello/Masiello_Group_Website/Home.html">Masiello Group</a> in the Physics department, for which I earned the Mary Gates Research Scholarship.

My interest in scientific research is long-standing and my earliest engagement with the discipline was working in the labs of Takato Imaizumi at UW and Ram Samudrala while in high school.
